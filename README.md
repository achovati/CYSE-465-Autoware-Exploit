# CYSE 465 Autoware Exploit

The goal is to find an exploit in the 3D perception stack of the Autoware simulator.
The expected approach is spoof a pcap file with dummy UDP data showing what a laser shining into the lidar sensor would look like.

Uploaded a file that contained contents of manually manipulated HEX Dump bytes which can be used to emulate our attack.

Uploaded a file that contained 11 manipulated packets that can be injected into the pcap file to observe the change in behavior and LGSVL environment.
